#Wondering Wandering


The Wandering Wondering presents a video installation of machines in its intimate state of information seeking, browsing through the web following its own algorithms. The project questions what the machines are looking for and what are our own conceptual and perceptual limits that makes this question hard to respond. Are they wondering or wandering around? What is it like to be browsing like a machine?
